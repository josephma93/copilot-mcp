Task: Complete the goal below using the relevant files as starting points.

Requirements:

- The relevant files list is only a pointer to key files; you may read or edit
  other files as needed to satisfy the goal.
- If you write or modify files, list every path and action (created/overwritten/appended) before the output; if no file writes, output "FILES: none".
- After the file list, return only the result required by the goal (no explanations, comments, or markdown fences); treat this output as authoritative.
