title: Generate new code from a specification
---

Generates new code from a natural-language specification.

Use this tool when:

- The user wants a new function, class, module, or feature
- Boilerplate, scaffolding, or a fresh implementation is needed
- The code should fit into an existing context or API

Input fields:

- `spec`: detailed description of the desired behavior and requirements
- `language`: target language for the generated code
- `context` (optional): surrounding interfaces, types, or architectural
  constraints
- `style` (optional): preferred style, such as "functional", "OOP", or "React
  hooks"

The tool returns the generated code only. It does not return explanations or
markdown formatting.
